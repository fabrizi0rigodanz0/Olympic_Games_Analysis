    "The solution aims to generate a table of medals won by each country during the 2016 Olympic Games, ensuring that team events are counted only once. First, the dataset is filtered to include only the 2016 data where medals were awarded. The solution then identifies team events by assuming that events with more than five participants are likely team events, based on the grouped participant count per event. This team event information is merged back into the original dataset. For team events, the solution keeps only the first occurrence of each team event-medal combination, effectively counting each team event once. The dataset is then grouped by country and medal type, counting the number of medals per type for each country. A pivot table is created to restructure the data, with countries as rows and medal types (Gold, Silver, Bronze) as columns. Missing values are filled with zeros to handle countries that did not win certain types of medals. Finally, the columns are ordered as Gold, Silver, and Bronze, and the top ten countries by medal count are displayed. This method provides a reasonable approximation for counting team event medals while ensuring individual events are correctly counted."
