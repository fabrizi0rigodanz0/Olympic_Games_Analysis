    "Data from the Olympic Games, for the period considered, were collected for each individual athlete in a given Olympic event (or race) and recorded in the file `athlete_events.csv`. For example, the following entry is for the first gold medal won by a Portuguese woman:\n",

It should be noted that, for each athlete, there is an identifier (`ID`) that is unique to that athlete and invariable - it remains for all Olympic events in which that athlete has participated, regardless of the edition (year).\n",

    "Regarding Olympic events, there are individual events and team events - e.g. football and the 4x100m relay are team events. In team events, the data includes one record for each athlete on the team.\n",

    "### Population\n",

    "CSV file `population.csv` includes information about the population of each country for a given year.\n",

    "\n",
    "CSV file `codes.csv` includes information about the different codes used for different countries.\n",
