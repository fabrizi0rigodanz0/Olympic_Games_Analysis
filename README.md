# Olympic_Games_Analysis
## Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of the Olympic Games data, covering various aspects such as athlete performance, demographic information, and country-specific statistics. The data is sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed records of athletes' performances, population data, and country codes.

## Data
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **Olympic Games Data (`athlete_events.csv`)**: Contains information about athletes, their events, and the medals they won.
2. **Population Data (`population.csv`)**: Provides population information for each country for a given year.
3. **Country Codes (`codes.csv`)**: Includes different codes used for countries, including the national Olympic code.

## Methodology
The analysis covers:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
- Visualization of key findings
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

### Key Techniques
- Data merging and transformation
- Visualization using Matplotlib
- Statistical analysis

## Results
The project uncovers several interesting insights, such as:
- Trends in Olympic participation over the years
- Medal distribution by country and sport
- Relationship between population size and Olympic success

## Usage
